### Salário Líquido (hybrid version)

Soon :-)

After creating a native iOS version I decided to go on with ionic to come up with this hybrid version.

### TODOS

* Not sure how to open the numerical pad in iOS using Cordova
* Related to the above I'm using HTML5 input type number as a workaround - but HTML5 validations are kicking in
and when deactivating it I had even more problems from an UX perspective :-/
* UX when informing the gross salary and switching to the slider is terrible. The user must click outside the keyboard section to dismiss it and be able to move the slider.
* A spinner indicating an on going HTTP call would be nice
